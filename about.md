I was introduced to coding in primary school on a BBC micro with game type-ins written in BASIC. I didn't really understand what I was doing and there was nobody who knew enough to mentor me. I drifted away from programming but stayed interested in computers and the internet. I learned HTML from `View Source` and made some web pages. I built a computer from bits of old computers and tinkered with linux. Lots of nothing happened.

In 2013, inspired by what?, I found Codecademy and coded every day. I met Javascript and hated it then I met Ruby and loved it. I wanted to make apps for iPhone and iPad but Objective C looked scary and incomprehensible. Luckily, 2014 would be the summer of Swift and I got to work learning it. I gave myself 6 months to get an app in the app store and just managed it with only few hours a week to myself before work. Swift was much friendlier but I still had general concepts to learn like OOP and MVC.

Parse used to be a super-easy backend for mobile and web apps but sadly it was retired. In an effort to replace it I decided to use my Ruby knowledge to learn Ruby on Rails. I'd tried before but the tutorials always got me stuck and never helped me get unstuck. This time I tried Michael Hartl's Ruby On Rails tutorial (Rails 5) - Learn Web Development with Rails. It's the best.

These days, I make a lot of apps to entertain my 2 year-old son on long journeys and make his favourite paper books come alive. I have also discovered the joys of Javascript with the help of P5.js.

I'm working towards the UBCx Software Development MicroMasters at the moment, learning systematic program design. 

This website is a home for project write-ups and videos of them in action. I love making stuff from code. Particularly games and interactive books for iOS using SpriteKit and Swift.
