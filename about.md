I was introduced to coding in primary school on a BBC micro with game type-ins written in BASIC.  

This is a home for code projects that I'm not too embarrassed about and general boasting. Kevin will talk about himself in the third person like Elmo because résumés. Kevin likes making stuff from code. Particularly games and interactive books for iOS using SpriteKit and Swift.

    import SpriteKit
