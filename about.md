I was introduced to coding in primary school on a BBC micro with game type-ins written in BASIC ([Go get the PDFs for free from Usborne!](https://usborne.com/browse-books/features/computer-and-coding-books/)). I didn't really understand what I was doing but it was fun. I didn't know how to move forward with programming but stayed interested in computers and the internet. I learned HTML and made some web pages with [Geoccities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities). I built a computer from bits of old computers and learned linux and the terminal.

In 2013 I got interested in coding again and coded every day with Javascript and Ruby and loved it. I wanted to make apps for iPhone and iPad but Objective C was daunting. Luckily, 2014 would be the summer of Swift; a language with a much more familiar syntax. I set a goal of getting an app in the app store with 6 months and just managed it, learning and coding only few hours a week before work.

In need of a backend for my mobile and web apps I decided to use my Ruby knowledge to learn Ruby on Rails with Michael Hartl's Ruby On Rails tutorial (Rails 5) - Learn Web Development with Rails. It's the best.

These days, I make a lot of apps to entertain my 3 year-old son on long journeys and try to make his favourite paper books come alive. I have also discovered the joys of [P5.js](https://p5js.org) and [Processing](https://processing.org/).

I'm working towards the [UBCx Software Development MicroMasters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Un95n-pNPiw) at the moment, learning systematic program design.

This website is a home for project write-ups and videos of them in action. I love making stuff from code.
