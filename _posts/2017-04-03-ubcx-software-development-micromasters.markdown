I'm currently pursuing the UBCx Software Development MicroMasters. I'm learning systematic program design and really enjoying it. The key things I've learned so far are:


* The design recipes
  * How to Design Functions
  * How to Design Data
  * How to Design Worlds
* Templating functions
  * Data Driven Templates
* The functional programming paradigm
* Test Driven Design
* Domain Analysis

Here's an example problem from the course and my solution. As you can see from my comments, I forgot to say which template rules I used and had to add them in later. Also, there's some inconsistency between the data definition using "Light" as the type name and the template using "light-state" for the function name. From now on I'll be trying to make sure they match.
