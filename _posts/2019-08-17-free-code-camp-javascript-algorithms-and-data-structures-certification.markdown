 I'm moving forward on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org). I just got my [Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/osakastarbux/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures).

 Some parts I was able to breeze through but sometimes I really got stuck and had to change my approach. Both are good. If it's a breeze I feel confident in my skill and if it's a challenge I get to enjoy hacking away at it and I celebrate when I crack it.

 Next I'm going to get started on the Front-end Libraries Certification. Highlights are React and Redux.
