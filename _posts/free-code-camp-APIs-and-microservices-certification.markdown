I just got my [APIs and Microservices Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/osakastarbux/apis-and-microservices) from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org). It took a long time.
The APIs were not so difficult to build but the tests were a bit quirky. One test cost me days and days.
I submitted a pull request today so that nobody else has to go through that.
