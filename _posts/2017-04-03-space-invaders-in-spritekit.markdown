This is the best classic video game Space Invaders. I started off with a tutorial but eventually went my own way. The invaders are initially unaffected by gravity. When the player loses their last life this property is changed and they fall and bounce on the ground.

Following the tutorial I moved the invaders using the update function. If I were to try this project again I would experiment with using SKAction alone to do the moving.

There are so many things I would like to add to this project but it's better to move on to new things.
