After completing How to Code: Simple Data, the first course of the UBCx Software Development MicroMasters, I decided to enter the Worked Problem Video Contest for that course. If you win, your video goes up on the course website for other students to see and you get one of the six courses in the MicroMasters for free. I decided to my screencast on working through a simple animation of snow falling. When you click in the window a snowflake appears and falls slowly. It's deliberately simple to keep the video short but the resulting video was still over an hour in length.

I ended up winning this round of the contest so here's my video.
