I'm on a roll. I just got my [Data Visualization Certification](data-visualization) from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org). I have to admit, this one was really tough. The learning curve for D3 was pretty steep. The results are pretty amazing though. You can create beautiful interactive visualizations with just a few lines of code.

The next certification is for APIs and Microservices.
